## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies for both frontend and backend.
3. Run the backend server using \`python src/backend/main.py\`.
4. Start the frontend application (depends on your setup, e.g., \`npm start\` or \`next dev\`).

## Docker Examples
The Dockerfile in the Docker_examples directory demonstrates the Dockerfile that could be used for analyzing a Docker command. 

## Conversation Log

The \`conversation/chat_log.md\` file contains the full conversation log between you and the AI assistant. This log includes all queries, responses, and code snippets discussed during the development process.

## Source Code

- The React frontend component is located in \`src/frontend/docker-learning-app.tsx\`.
- The Python backend is located in \`src/backend/main.py\`.

## Documentation

Additional project documentation and summaries can be found in the \`docs/\` directory.

## Working with Other AI Assistants

When working with other AI assistants like Claude:

1. Share the entire project directory or a zip file containing all the files.
2. Direct the AI to review the \`README.md\` file first for an overview of the project structure.
3. Refer to specific files or sections of the conversation log as needed during your interaction.

## Version Control

This project uses Git for version control. You can use standard Git commands to track changes and create new branches as needed.
